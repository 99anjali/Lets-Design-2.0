Character Description (including Backstory) :


Folk-Z, a very seasoned developer from IIITA,once came to know about the Opencode event conducted by Geekhaven IIITA. Looking at the exciting prize pool, folk-Z became very greedy.He tried every possible method to selfishly claim as many issues as possible and earn points .


He was the overall winner of that year's opencode.


Few days later folk-Z got a project idea , but realised that he had no one to share the idea with . The feeling of loneliness hitted him hard. Looking back he pointed out that in his journey he became a very good coder but not a good “contributor” and was unsuccessful in building a network/community.
From then onwards folk-z voluntarily took over the responsibility of encouraging young and budding developers to form and contribute to a healthy community thus becoming a representative of open code. Presently folk-Z guides new developers through the opencode in their open source and development journey and continuously educates them with his experience.
